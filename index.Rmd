# Welcome {-}

We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists and educators developing culturally-aware environmental data science modules for undergraduate classrooms and workshops. We are looking to grow our earth and environmental data sciences community and to support undergraduate Indigenous students through mentorship, research opportunities, and preparation for graduate programs.
