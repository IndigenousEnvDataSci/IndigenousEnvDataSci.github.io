The EFI Methods and Cyberinfrastructure EFI Working Groups are compiling common tasks in ecological forecasting and methods and tools to help with tasks commonly used in ecological forecasting for the following categories. 

* Reproducible Forecasting Workflows
* Modeling & Statistical resources, including Uncertainty Quantification & Propagation 
* Data Ingest, Cleaning, and Management
* Visualization, Decision Support, and User Interfaces.  

These Resources and tools listed in the four categories of tasks are meant to be living documents.  This list is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of all possible resources, as there are some tasks where there are hundreds of different tools available. Instead we focus on commonly used tools.  However, if there are often used tools and resources we are missing,  we welcome input from anyone â€” suggestions can be shared as Issues to the [eco4cast/taskview GitHub repository](https://github.com/eco4cast/taskviews).
