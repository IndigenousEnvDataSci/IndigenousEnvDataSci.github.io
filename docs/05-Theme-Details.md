### Focal variables

#### Surface Mean Daily Dissolved Oxygen Concentration

**Definition**

Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water. NEON’s 30-minute time resolution from deployed water quality sondes among the freshwater sites reports this concentration as mg L-1. We have adapted the available NEON DO data to output the mean daily DO concentration in mg L-1 from a water quality sonde deployed 1m below the water surface at a lake site (Barco Lake) and a water quality sonde deployed in a stream site (Posey Creek). Common DO concentrations range between 0 and 12 mg L-1 and DO concentrations less than 2 mg L-1 are considered hypoxic. 
Motivation

Dissolved oxygen concentration is a critically important variable in limnology. Forecasts of dissolved oxygen in freshwaters is the first step to understanding other freshwater ecosystem processes. For example, oxygen serves as the gatekeeper to other biogeochemical reactions that occur as well as determine the variety and health of aquatic organisms present in rivers and lakes. Preemptive forecasts of dissolved oxygen concentrations can anticipate periods of high or low oxygen availability, thereby providing insight into how the ecosystem may change at relatively short timescales. 

#### Surface Mean Daily Water Temperature
**Definition**
Water temperature is the temperature of the water. NEON’s 30-minute time resolution from deployed water temperature sondes in the freshwater sites reports this in degrees celsius (°C). We have adapted the available NEON water temperature data to output the mean daily water temperature in °C from a water temperature sonde deployed 1m below the water surface at a lake site (Barco Lake) and a water temperature sonde deployed in a stream site (Posey Creek). Common water temperatures in lakes and streams range between 4 and 35 °C.
Motivation

In streams and rivers, forecasting water temperature can be meaningful for protecting aquatic communities while maintaining socio-economic benefits (Ouellet-Proulx et al. 2017). In lentic and lotic systems, successfully forecasting water temperatures can be important for management of fisheries and water utilities that rely on specific threshold  temperatures (Zhu et al. 2020). Recently, lake temperature forecasts have been used to predict seasonal turnover, mixing bottom nutrients into the surface and impairing water quality.Data
